Hi! My name is Rouke Broersma. I'm a software developer and open source enthousiast.

My day-to-day involves developing the dotnet developer experience platforms provided to coworkers and customers at [Info Support](https://infosupport.com). 
In my free time I work on [Stryker](https://stryker-mutator.io), the mutation testing platform for dotnet.

Currently my main focus area is azure infrastructure (as code). Go [Bicep](https://github.com/Azure/bicep)!
